# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to: (1)Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk; (2)Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk; and (3)Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk

## Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.





## Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
